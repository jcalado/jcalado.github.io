ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joel â€” a software developer who loves building modern, user-focused web applications. I spend most of my coding hours exploring the possibilities of React, Node.js, and all things JavaScript, turning ideas into solutions that (hopefully!) make life a little easier.

I also enjoy tinkering with hardware an designing neat little solutions for my problems.

Lately, Iâ€™ve also been falling in love with Amateur Radio (CS7BLE) â€” a hobby that connects curiosity, problem-solving, and community in surprising ways. Just like with software, thereâ€™s always something new to learn, tinker with, and share.

This blog is my corner of the internet to write about the projects Iâ€™m working on, the lessons I pick up, and the insights that come from both code and radio waves.
