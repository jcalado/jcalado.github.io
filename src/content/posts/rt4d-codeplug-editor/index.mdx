# RT4D Codeplug Editor: A Modern, Open-Source Tool for Your RT-4D/Retevis RT84 Radio

[Source code at https://github.com/jcalado/rt4d-cps](https://github.com/jcalado/rt4d-cps)

## What is RT4D Codeplug Editor?

If you own a Radtel RT-4D (analog/DMR) radio, you know that programming it with the official Chinese Programming Software (CPS) can be... challenging. That's where RT4D Codeplug Editor comes in - a modern, open-source alternative built from the ground up to make radio programming straightforward and reliable.

## Why Use RT4D Editor?

### üéØ Built for Accuracy

Unlike guesswork-based editors, RT4D Editor was developed through careful reverse-engineering of the official CPS. Every setting, every byte offset, every dropdown value has been verified against the official software to ensure your radio configuration is exactly what you expect.

### üñ•Ô∏è Clean, Modern Interface

- Tabbed interface for organized access to Channels, Contacts, Zones, and Settings
- Real-time editing with immediate visual feedback
- Advanced settings dialog for power users who want full control
- Cross-platform support - works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

### üì° Complete Feature Support

**Channel Management:**
- Supports all 1024 channels
- Both analog (FM/AM/SSB) and DMR digital modes
- Full CTCSS/DCS sub-tone support (all 210+ codes)
- Scrambler, encryption, and privacy features
- Talkaround, scan, and alarm settings

**Contact & Zone Organization:**
- Manage up to 1000 DMR contacts
- Group lists for organized contact groups
- Zone-based channel organization
- All Call, Group Call, and Private Call support

**Radio Settings:**
- **Identity:** Radio name, DMR ID, startup messages
- **Audio:** Separate controls for analog and DMR audio
  - TX Mic Gain (0-31) and RX Speaker Volume (0-63)
  - DMR Call audio with independent gain controls (0-24)
  - Beep settings for various events
- **Display:** LCD contrast, brightness, display modes
- **Power management** and dual-watch settings
- **4 programmable clock/timers**
- **Frequency lock ranges** for band limiting
- **Scan settings** (direction, dwell time, modes)
- **Function key programming** (40 different actions)
- **DMR enhancements:** hang times, remote control, call display
- **Advanced:** NOAA weather channels, spectrum scan, detection range

## How It Works

The editor reads and writes `.4rdmf` files - the binary codeplug format used by the RT-4D radio. The file structure includes:

- **CFG Section** (4096 bytes): Radio settings, identity, audio, display
- **Channels** (1024 √ó 48 bytes): All channel data
- **Contacts** (1000 √ó 32 bytes): DMR contact directory
- **Group Lists** (250 √ó 288 bytes): Contact groupings
- **Zones** (250 √ó 512 bytes): Channel organization
- **Encryption Keys** (256 √ó 40 bytes): Privacy keys

Every field has been mapped to its exact byte offset through careful analysis of the official CPS software, ensuring 100% compatibility with your radio.

## Technical Details

For the technically curious:

**Built With:**
- Python 3.x
- PySide6 (Qt6) for the GUI
- Binary parsing with struct module
- GBK text encoding for Chinese character support
- BCD encoding for DMR IDs

**Key Architecture:**
- `models.py` - Data structures for all codeplug entities
- `parser.py` - Binary file reading and conversion to Python objects
- `serializer.py` - Python objects back to binary format
- `dropdowns.py` - All valid values for radio settings
- `gui/` - Qt-based user interface

**File Format Documentation:**
Complete documentation of the `.4rdmf` binary format is included in `CODEPLUG_FORMAT.md`, making it easy for other developers to build compatible tools.

## Getting Started

1. **Read from Radio:** Use the official CPS to read your current config and save as `.4rdmf`
2. **Open in RT4D Editor:** Load the file and make your changes
3. **Save:** Export back to `.4rdmf` format
4. **Write to Radio:** Use the official CPS to write the modified file back

## Settings Organization

The Advanced Settings dialog logically groups related settings:

- **üìª Analog Audio Settings** - Squelch, mic gain, speaker volume, beeps for FM/AM/SSB operation
- **üîä DMR Audio Settings** - Separate controls optimized for digital voice with call-specific audio levels
- **üñ•Ô∏è Display Settings** - Screen brightness, contrast, display modes
- **üì° DMR Operation Settings** - Remote control, hang times, call display
- **‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features** - NOAA, spectrum scan, detection settings

## Open Source & Community Driven

RT4D Codeplug Editor is open-source software, developed through reverse-engineering the official CPS to provide accurate, reliable radio programming. The project welcomes contributions, bug reports, and feature requests.

**Key Benefits of Open Source:**
- **Transparent code** - see exactly what's happening with your radio data
- **Community improvements** - bugs get fixed quickly
- **Cross-platform** - not locked to Windows
- **Future-proof** - won't become abandonware

## What's Next?

Future enhancements on the roadmap:
- DTMF programming system UI (data structure complete)
- Import/export from CSV for bulk editing

## Conclusion

Whether you're a ham radio operator, professional radio user, or just someone who wants reliable control over your RT-4D radio programming, RT4D Codeplug Editor offers a modern, accurate, and user-friendly alternative to the official CPS.
