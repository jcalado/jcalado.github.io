# Repetidores - Your Complete Amateur Radio Companion for Portugal

> **Update:** Repetidores has moved! The application is now available at [radioamador.info](https://radioamador.info). All features and functionality remain and there's so much more at the new domain.


[Repetidores](https://repetidores.jcalado.com) is an all-in-one Progressive Web App for Portuguese amateur radio operators. Instead of juggling multiple websites and resources, Repetidores brings together everything you need in one place: repeater data, band plan information, and upcoming ham radio events.

## The Problem

Amateur radio operators in Portugal were dealing with fragmented information scattered across multiple sources. Finding repeater details meant one website, checking band plans required another, and discovering local events meant searching through various channels. Whether you're planning a trip, setting up your radio equipment, or looking for the next ham radio gathering, having to consult multiple resources is inefficient and frustrating.

## The Solution: A One-Stop-Shop for Ham Radio in Portugal

Repetidores consolidates the essential resources Portuguese amateur radio operators need into a single, modern platform. With over 190 repeaters in the database, comprehensive band plan information, and an events calendar, you can access everything from one convenient location.

The application combines powerful search and filtering with interactive visualization, giving operators both the detailed technical specifications they need and the geographic context to make informed decisions.

## Three Essential Resources in One Place
