# Repetidores - Your Complete Amateur Radio Companion for Portugal

Instead of juggling multiple websites and resources, Repetidores brings together everything you need in one place: repeater data, band plan information, and upcoming ham radio events.

## The Problem

Amateur radio operators in Portugal were dealing with fragmented information scattered across multiple sources. Finding repeater details meant one website, checking band plans required another, and discovering local events meant searching through various channels. Whether you're planning a trip, setting up your radio equipment, or looking for the next ham radio gathering, having to consult multiple resources is inefficient and frustrating.
