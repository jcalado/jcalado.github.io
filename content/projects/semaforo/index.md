# Semáforo de Vacinação COVID - Mobile app

This react-native app will consume the same data as https://covid19.min-saude.pt/cvc and present it in a friendly manner.
It is my first react-native app, so some things might not be 100% up to standard.


# Features

- Downloads realtime data from the API endpoint
- Searches by location or center name
- Shows a map with API provided markers so you can have a sense of scale. There are a lot of centers!
- Displays how old the API provided data is, so the user is not mislead.
- Provides undocumented stats such as "Pessoas em recobro", "Pessoas em espera"
- Pull down to refresh data
