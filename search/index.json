It should detect your DFU mode keyboard.\nCopy the anne_pro_default.dfu file from your WSL installation to somewhere the app can access it.\nOn the \u0026ldquo;Upgrade and verify\u0026rdquo; section of the app, click choose, pick your dfu file, then click upgrade.\nThis should erase the current firmware and load the new one. When complete (there\u0026rsquo;s a progress bar), press the reset button on the back of the keyboard.\nDone ü•≥ You now have a working Anne Pro with QMK. Customize your own keymap if you want.

You can hold right shift and tap left shift to type \u0026gt;. I usually type with an ISO keyboard and do lots of coding. I wanted to keep this key next to the left shift, so mod-tap was an option.
